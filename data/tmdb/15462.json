{"overview": "This day-in-the-life cult comedy focuses on a group of friends working at Sully Boyar's Car Wash in the Los Angeles ghetto. The team meets dozens of eccentric customers -- including a smooth-talking preacher, a wacky cab driver and an ex-convict -- while cracking politically incorrect jokes to a constant soundtrack of disco and funk. Some of the workers find romance as the day moves along, but most are just happy to get through another shift.", "popularity": 12.684, "original_title": "Car Wash", "runtime": 97, "release_date": "1976-10-22", "vote_average": 5.889, "vote_count": 95, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Hey, it's a '70s thing!", "spoken_languages": "es|en", "cast": "Ivan Dixon|DeWayne Jessie|Bill Duke|Franklyn Ajaye|Sully Boyar", "id": 15462}

{"overview": "In the Kerepesi Street cemetery, three grave diggers contemplate the fate of the world, then they step out of this role and in a sequence of episodes they play the typical figures of contemporary Hungarian reality, the fat cat, the swashbuckler, the victim, underworld chieftains, and present little absurd dramas of love, marriage, friendship, public order and legal safety. The author and the film director walk among them all the time, contemplating, laughing at their plays. The stories starting from the graveyard and returning there warn of the inevitability of death. The author and the director (Gyula Hern\u00e1di and Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3) wisely make friends with death.", "popularity": 2.57, "original_title": "Nekem l\u00e1mp\u00e1st adott kezembe az \u00dar Pesten", "runtime": 103, "release_date": "1999-01-28", "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 7, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Ha \u00e9n \u00e1llat lenn\u00e9k, nem tartan\u00e9k embert a lak\u00e1sban...", "spoken_languages": "hu", "cast": "Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi|P\u00e9ter Scherer|J\u00f3zsef Szarvas|Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3|Gyula Hern\u00e1di", "id": 104515}

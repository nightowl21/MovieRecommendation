{"overview": "Good hearted but not very wordly-wise, Dante is happy driving the school bus for a group of mentally handicapped children, while feeling he is somehow missing out on life and love. So he is very excited when after nearly being knocked down by her car he meets Maria, who seems immediately enamoured of him. He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.", "popularity": 9.587, "original_title": "Johnny Stecchino", "runtime": 115, "release_date": "1991-10-24", "vote_average": 7.341, "vote_count": 965, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Sometimes a banana is just a banana!", "spoken_languages": "it", "cast": "Roberto Benigni|Nicoletta Braschi|Paolo Bonacelli|Franco Volpi|Ivano Marescotti", "id": 12776}

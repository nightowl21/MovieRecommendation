{"overview": "For cynical tabloid journo Richard Dees, facts are always stranger than fiction. Every headline is a dead-line. Serial killers, UFO abductions, tales of molestation, mayhem and murder. To some the tales are mere sleazy fantasy \u2013 but his faithful readers believe. And now there's a new story: The Night Flier. What is it that travels by night in a dark-winged Cessna, lands at secluded airfields and murders local residents? Dees begins to track the unknown killer in a Cessna of his own, uncovering clues that reveal a pilot more terrifying than he could have ever imagined.", "popularity": 10.806, "original_title": "The Night Flier", "runtime": 93, "release_date": "1997-04-30", "vote_average": 6.009, "vote_count": 212, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Evil has a flight plan.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Miguel Ferrer|Julie Entwisle|Dan Monahan|Michael H.

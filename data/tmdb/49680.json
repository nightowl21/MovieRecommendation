{"overview": "Zaza is a 31-year old Israeli bachelor, handsome and intelligent, and his family wants to see him married. But tradition dictates that Zaza has to choose a young virgin. She must be beautiful and from a good family, preferably rich. Zaza's parents, Yasha and Lily drag Zaza to meet potential brides and their families. Zaza has no choice. He plays along with his family, advocates of the suffocating traditions of their Georgian Jewish heritage. But Zaza always manages to somehow get out of being engaged. What his parents don't know is that Zaza is already in love. Judith is sensuous, strong and intriguing. She's also a divorc\u00e9e with a 6-year-old daughter. So Zaza has kept Judith a secret from his family. He will have to choose between respect of the strict confines of family and tradition, or the love of his life.", "popularity": 4.524, "original_title": "\u05d7\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea", "runtime": 102, "release_date": "2001-10-24", "vote_average": 6.214, "vote_count": 28, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "ka|he", "cast": "Lior Ashkenazi|Ronit Elkabetz|Moni Moshonov|Lili Koshashvili|Aya Steinovitz", "id": 49680}

{"overview": "For years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace, who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales... until she meets Pete, a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete's descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham's stories. With the help of Natalie, an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon.", "popularity": 22.219, "original_title": "Pete's Dragon", "runtime": 103, "release_date": "2016-08-10", "vote_average": 6.377, "vote_count": 2094, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Some secrets are too big to keep.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Oakes Fegley|Bryce Dallas Howard|Wes Bentley|Karl Urban|Oona Laurence", "id": 294272}

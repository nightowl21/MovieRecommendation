{"overview": "Homicide detective Sean Nault is a cop on a parallel Earth whose technology is powered exclusively by magic. Sean investigates a baffling series of murders committed by a means he's never seen before: science. With the aid of Lenoir, a member of the ridiculed subculture of \"pragmatists\" who believe science is more than the stuff of myths & children's stories, and the 130-year-old sorcerer Winston Churchill, Sean uncovers an ominous plot that will lead him to another dimension and the realization that, unless he prevents it, both earths could well be destroyed.", "popularity": 2.483, "original_title": "Paradox", "runtime": 82, "release_date": "2010-01-01", "vote_average": 4.4, "vote_count": 15, "status": "Released", "tagline": "A Crimefighter, on a parallel Earth, Powered by Magic.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Kevin Sorbo|Steph Song|Christopher Judge|A.C.

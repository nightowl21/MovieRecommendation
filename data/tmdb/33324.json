{"overview": "This film documents the coal miners' strike against the Brookside Mine of the Eastover Mining Company in Harlan County, Kentucky in June, 1973. Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.", "popularity": 5.03, "original_title": "Harlan County U.S.A.", "runtime": 103, "release_date": "1977-01-23", "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 88, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Which Side Are You On?", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Norman Yarborough|Houston Elmore|Phil Sparks|Bessie Lou Cornett|Sudie Crusenberry", "id": 33324}

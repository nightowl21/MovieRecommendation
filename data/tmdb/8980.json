The T.I.A Chief, though, is firm in his resolve: if he wants to get the D.O.T. back, he must NOT count on his agents Mortadelo & Filemon. But when the crime fighting duo discover that the T.I.A. has engaged a cocky and slimy detective from outside the agency, they decide to act at their own risk, even if that risk involves all of Humanity.", "popularity": 9.148, "original_title": "La gran aventura de Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n", "runtime": 88, "release_date": "2003-02-07", "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 113, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "ca|es|fr|en", "cast": "Benito Pocino|Pepe Viyuela|Dominique Pinon|Paco Sagarzazu|Mariano Venancio", "id": 8980}

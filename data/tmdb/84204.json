{"overview": "Something sinister has come to the shores of Erin Island, unbeknownst to the quaint population of this sleepy fishing village resting somewhere off Ireland\u2019s coast. First, some fishermen go missing. Then there is the rash of whale carcasses suddenly washing up on the beach. When the murders start, it\u2019s up to two mismatched cops \u2013 an irresponsible alcoholic and his new partner, a by-the-book woman from the mainland \u2013 to protect the townsfolk from the giant, bloodsucking, tentacled aliens that prey upon them. Their only weapon, they discover, is booze. If they want to survive the creatures\u2019 onslaught, everyone will have to get very, very drunk!", "popularity": 18.281, "original_title": "Grabbers", "runtime": 94, "release_date": "2012-08-10", "vote_average": 6.093, "vote_count": 410, "status": "Released", "tagline": "For the locals on Erin Island, it's last orders.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Richard Coyle|Ruth Bradley|Russell Tovey|Bronagh Gallagher|David Pearse", "id": 84204}

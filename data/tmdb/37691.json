{"overview": "Maya is a quick-witted young woman who comes over the Mexican border without papers and makes her way to the LA home of her older sister Rosa. Rosa gets Maya a job as a janitor: a non-union janitorial service has the contract, the foul-mouthed supervisor can fire workers on a whim, and the service-workers' union has assigned organizer Sam Shapiro to bring its \"justice for janitors\" campaign to the building. Sam finds Maya a willing listener, she's also attracted to him. Rosa resists, she has an ailing husband to consider. The workers try for public support; management intimidates workers to divide and conquer. Rosa and Maya as well as workers and management may be set to collide.", "popularity": 9.144, "original_title": "Bread and Roses", "runtime": 110, "release_date": "2000-05-10", "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 104, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The Balance of Power Is About to Change", "spoken_languages": "en|es", "cast": "Pilar Padilla|Adrien Brody|Jack McGee|Monica Rivas|Frankie Davila", "id": 37691}

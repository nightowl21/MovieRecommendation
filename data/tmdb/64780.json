{"overview": "Over a quarter of a century since it began and a decade after it folded, this is the definitive film about Creation Records, one of the world's most successful and colorful independent labels. This is the story of the rock n roll dream and its accompanying nightmares. Millions of sales on both sides of the Atlantic, near bankruptcy, pills, thrills, spats, prats, success, excess, pick me ups, breakdowns and of course some of THE defining music of the late 20th Century. This is the definitive and fully authorised story of the UK's most inspired and dissolute label, from the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain at the Living Room to Oasis at Knebworth.", "popularity": 1.049, "original_title": "Upside Down: The Creation Records Story", "runtime": 101, "release_date": "2010-10-19", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 11, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The story of \u2019The most Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll label ever\u2019", "spoken_languages": "", "cast": "Alan McGee|Bobby Gillespie|Noel Gallagher", "id": 64780}

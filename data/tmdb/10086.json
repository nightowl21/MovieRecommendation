{"overview": "The activities of rampaging, indiscriminate serial killer Ben are recorded by a willingly complicit documentary team, who eventually become his accomplices and active participants. Ben provides casual commentary on the nature of his work and arbitrary musings on topics of interest to him, such as music or the conditions of low-income housing, and even goes so far as to introduce the documentary crew to his family. But their reckless indulgences soon get the better of them.", "popularity": 13.038, "original_title": "C'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous", "runtime": 96, "release_date": "1992-08-20", "vote_average": 7.221, "vote_count": 820, "status": "Released", "tagline": "It happened in your neighborhood", "spoken_languages": "fr|it", "cast": "Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde|R\u00e9my Belvaux|Andr\u00e9 Bonzel|Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert|Val\u00e9rie Parent", "id": 10086}

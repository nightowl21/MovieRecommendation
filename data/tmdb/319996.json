{"overview": "Things are hectic in heaven. Dozens of scribes sit before a long scroll incessantly scribbling away. They are composing the biographies of earth-dwellers. What is invented by the men in heaven is lived out below. And their employer, God, is increasingly vehement in demanding avant-garde ideas. Take, for example, the beautiful Yuri, a girl who dies in a car crash. Some of the heavenly scribes find this very dull and send former gangster Chas, who has become a heavenly tea-boy, back down to earth with instructions to save Yuri no matter what. And so Chas ends up in Okinawa, gets to know the earth-dwellers, interferes in their fates, becomes celebrated as 'Mr Angel' and is hounded by brutal enemies. His falling in love with Yuri is of course a foregone conclusion. But no one could anticipate what happens next. Not even God himself", "popularity": 5.259, "original_title": "\u5929\u306e\u8336\u52a9", "runtime": 106, "release_date": "2015-02-13", "vote_average": 6.611, "vote_count": 9, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "ja", "cast": "Kenichi Matsuyama|Ito Ohno|Y\u00fbsuke Iseya|Hiromasa Taguchi|Tina Tamashiro", "id": 319996}

The unicorn sets out to discover the truth behind the butterfly's words. She is eventually joined on her quest by Schmendrick, a second-rate magician, and Molly Grue, a now middle-aged woman who dreamed all her life of seeing a unicorn. Their journey leads them far from home, all the way to the castle of King Haggard.", "popularity": 15.742, "original_title": "The Last Unicorn", "runtime": 92, "release_date": "1982-11-19", "vote_average": 7.138, "vote_count": 428, "status": "Released", "tagline": "There's Magic in Believing!", "spoken_languages": "en|de", "cast": "Alan Arkin|Jeff Bridges|Mia Farrow|Tammy Grimes|Robert Klein", "id": 10150}

{"overview": "Outrageous, misogynistic and vulgar-to-the-max comedian Andrew Dice Clay does his stuff in this combination stand-up concert video and series of comedy sketches. The sketches, demonstrating that The Dice Man used to be a klutzy wimp, begin the film which then jumps into a filled-to-capacity performance at Madison Square Gardens. The film contains strong profanity, blatant racist remarks, graphic references to sex and other \"adult\" subjects.", "popularity": 2.339, "original_title": "Andrew Dice Clay: Dice Rules", "runtime": 85, "release_date": "1991-05-17", "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 6, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Untamed!

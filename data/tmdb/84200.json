{"overview": "College \"frenemies\" Lauren and Katie move in together after losing a relationship and rent control, respectively. Sharing Katie's late grandmother's apartment in New York City, the girls bicker with each other until one fateful night, when Katie's noisy bedroom activities make Lauren barge in and discover a dirty little secret. This revelation brings them closer together, and Lauren (the brains) and Katie (the talent) concoct a wildly successful business venture. As profits swell, the girls reevaluate their hopes and dreams and realize that just because someone pees in your hair in college doesn't mean she won't be your best friend 10 years later.", "popularity": 9.305, "original_title": "For a Good Time, Call...", "runtime": 85, "release_date": "2012-08-31", "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 278, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Lose your hang-ups.

{"overview": "In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne finds herself increasingly intrigued by the handsome but aloof poet John Keats, who lives next door to her family friends the Dilkes. After reading a book of his poetry, she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats. Although he agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats cannot act on his reciprocated feelings for Fanny, since as a struggling poet he has no money to support a wife.", "popularity": 8.74, "original_title": "Bright Star", "runtime": 119, "release_date": "2009-11-05", "vote_average": 6.595, "vote_count": 405, "status": "Released", "tagline": "First love burns brightest.", "spoken_languages": "fr|en", "cast": "Abbie Cornish|Ben Whishaw|Paul Schneider|Kerry Fox|Edie Martin", "id": 29963}

When their childhood friend Ella returns to town to start a veterinary practice, however, Tully falls for her \u2014 although the townsfolk have their doubts that he could ever commit to one woman.", "popularity": 2.465, "original_title": "Tully", "runtime": 106, "release_date": "2002-11-01", "vote_average": 6.225, "vote_count": 20, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Anson Mount|Julianne Nicholson|Glenn Fitzgerald|Catherine Kellner|V.

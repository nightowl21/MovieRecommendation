{"overview": "This documentary follows various migratory bird species on their long journeys from their summer homes to the equator and back, covering thousands of miles and navigating by the stars. These arduous treks are crucial for survival, seeking hospitable climates and food sources. Birds face numerous challenges, including crossing oceans and evading predators, illness, and injury. Although migrations are undertaken as a community, birds disperse into family units once they reach their destinations, and every continent is affected by these migrations, hosting migratory bird species at least part of the year.", "popularity": 8.737, "original_title": "Le peuple migrateur", "runtime": 89, "release_date": "2001-12-12", "vote_average": 7.574, "vote_count": 163, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The amazing odysseys of traveling birds", "spoken_languages": "en|fr", "cast": "Philippe Labro|Jacques Perrin", "id": 11516}

{"overview": "Bud Spencer plays Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port (hence his name). One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat taken away and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest.", "popularity": 9.917, "original_title": "Banana Joe", "runtime": 96, "release_date": "1982-03-24", "vote_average": 6.665, "vote_count": 423, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "it", "cast": "Bud Spencer|Marina Langner|Mario Scarpetta|Gianfranco Barra|Enzo Garinei", "id": 11340}

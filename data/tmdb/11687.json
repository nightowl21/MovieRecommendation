{"overview": "This outrageous time-travel comedy follows the misadventures of a wacky medieval knight (Jean Reno) and his faithful servant when they are accidentally transported to contemporary times by a senile sorcerer. Mayhem rules as these 12th-century visitors try adapting to the wildly confusing modern world. To avoid being stuck here for good, however, they soon begin an all-out cosmic assault on their former castle -- now a luxury hotel -- in their quest to return to the past.", "popularity": 21.646, "original_title": "Les Visiteurs", "runtime": 107, "release_date": "1993-01-27", "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 1767, "status": "Released", "tagline": "They weren't born yesterday!", "spoken_languages": "fr", "cast": "Jean Reno|Christian Clavier|Val\u00e9rie Lemercier|Marie-Anne Chazel|Christian Bujeau", "id": 11687}

{"overview": "Around 1940, New Yorker staff writer Joe Mitchell meets Joe Gould, a Greenwich Village character who cadges meals, drinks, and contributions to the Joe Gould Fund and who is writing a voluminous Oral History of the World, a record of 20,000 conversations he's overheard. Mitchell is fascinated with this Harvard grad and writes a 1942 piece about him, \"Professor Seagull,\" bringing Gould some celebrity and an invitation to join the Greenwich Village Ravens, a poetry club he's often crashed. Gould's touchy, querulous personality and his frequent dropping in on Mitchell for hours of chat lead to a breakup, but the two Joes stay in touch until Gould's death and Mitchell's unveiling of the secret.", "popularity": 1.818, "original_title": "Joe Gould's Secret", "runtime": 104, "release_date": "2000-01-21", "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 13, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Ian Holm|Stanley Tucci|Hope Davis|Sarah Hyland|Hallee Hirsh", "id": 125709}

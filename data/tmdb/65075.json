{"overview": "In 1955, Tobias Schneebaum disappeared into the depths of the Peruvian Amazon. He had no guide, no map, and only the vaguest of instructions: Keep the river on your right. A year later Schneebaum emerged from the jungle\u2026naked, covered in body paint, and a modern-day cannibal.  Titled after Schneebaum\u2019s 1969 cult classic memoir about his formative experiences living in the Amazon, Keep The River On Your Right is the extraordinary stranger-than-fiction story of Schneebaum\u2019s return to the jungle, 45 years after his original visit, to reunite with the very tribesmen he loved and who gave him nightmares for nearly half a century. A deeply affecting and searing portrait, sibling filmmakers Laurie and David Shapiro capture a man in utter conflict, a fearless adventurer, and one of the most charming, enigmatic, and perplexing men ever captured on screen.", "popularity": 1.862, "original_title": "Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale", "runtime": 82, "release_date": "2000-04-15", "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 17, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en|es", "cast": "Tobias Schneebaum|Norman Mailer|Michael Nelson Rockefeller", "id": 65075}

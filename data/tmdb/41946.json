{"overview": "It's 1649: Mazarin hires the impoverished D'Artagnan to find the other musketeers: Cromwell has overthrown the English king, so Mazarin fears revolt, particularly from the popular Beaufort. Porthos, bored with riches and wanting a title, signs on, but Aramis, an abb\u00e9, and Athos, a brawler raising an intellectual son, assist Beaufort in secret. When they fail to halt Beaufort's escape from prison, the musketeers are expendable, and Mazarin sends them to London to rescue Charles I. They are also pursued by Justine, the avenging daughter of Milady de Winter, their enemy 20 years ago. They must escape England, avoid Justine, serve the Queen, and secure Beauford's political reforms.", "popularity": 9.871, "original_title": "The Return of the Musketeers", "runtime": 102, "release_date": "1989-04-12", "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 127, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Michael York|Oliver Reed|Frank Finlay|C.

{"overview": "Comedian Dave Chappelle does what he does best in this outrageous and hilarious standup performance, which allows him to push the envelope far beyond what he does on his TV show. Taped in San Francisco at the famed Fillmore, Chappelle lets loose on such topics as black celebrities, what it's like to have raunchy fans of his TV show approach him while he's trying to enjoy Disneyland with his kids, Michael Jackson, Kobe Bryant... and crackheads, of course.  It's comedy Chappelle-style and, for what it's worth, no one is safe from his barbs. But you already knew that!", "popularity": 7.662, "original_title": "Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth", "runtime": 58, "release_date": "2004-09-04", "vote_average": 7.613, "vote_count": 119, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Live at the Fillmore", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Dave Chappelle", "id": 20147}

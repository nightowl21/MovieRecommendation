When Ben finally gets accepted into the academy, he thinks he's earned the seasoned policeman's respect and asks for his blessing to marry Angela. Knowing that a ride along will demonstrate if Ben has what it takes to take care of his sister, James invites him on a shift designed to scare the hell out of the trainee. But when the wild night leads them to the most notorious criminal in the city, James will find that his new partner's rapid-fire mouth is just as dangerous as the bullets speeding at it.", "popularity": 14.534, "original_title": "Ride Along", "runtime": 99, "release_date": "2014-01-07", "vote_average": 6.246, "vote_count": 2118, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Propose to this cop's sister?

{"overview": "British documentarian Nick Broomfield creates a follow-up piece to his 1992 documentary of the serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a highway prostitute who was convicted of killing six men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. Interviewing an increasingly mentally unstable Wuornos, Broomfield captures the distorted mind of a murderer whom the state of Florida deems of sound mind -- and therefore fit to execute. Throughout the film, Broomfield includes footage of his testimony at Wuornos' trial.", "popularity": 7.824, "original_title": "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer", "runtime": 89, "release_date": "2003-09-09", "vote_average": 6.812, "vote_count": 117, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The 2002 Interviews.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Aileen Wuornos|Nick Broomfield|Diane Wuornos|Arlene Pralle|Tyria Moore", "id": 37088}

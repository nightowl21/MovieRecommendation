{"overview": "Paris, in the early 1960s. Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school. The affluent man lives a steady yet boring life. At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in. There live a crowd of lively Spanish maids who will help Jean-Louis to open to a new civilization and a new approach of life. In their company - and more precisely in the company of beautiful Maria - Jean-Louis will gradually become another man, a better man.", "popularity": 8.138, "original_title": "Les Femmes du 6e \u00e9tage", "runtime": 106, "release_date": "2011-02-16", "vote_average": 6.812, "vote_count": 357, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Help is on the way.", "spoken_languages": "fr|es", "cast": "Fabrice Luchini|Sandrine Kiberlain|Natalia Verbeke|Carmen Maura|Lola Due\u00f1as", "id": 57243}

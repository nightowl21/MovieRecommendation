{"overview": "Originally released in Japan as \"The Return of Godzilla\"  in 1984, this is the heavily re-edited, re-titled \"Godzilla 1985\".  Adding in new footage of Raymond Burr, this 16th Godzilla film ignores all previous sequels and serves as a direct follow-up to the 1956 \"Godzilla King of the Monsters\", which also featured scenes with Burr edited into 1954's \"Godzilla\".

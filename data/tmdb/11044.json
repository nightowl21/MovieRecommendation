{"overview": "An Innuit hunter races his sled home with a fresh-caught halibut. This fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile, Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there, but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding. It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet turtles", "popularity": 11.643, "original_title": "Arizona Dream", "runtime": 142, "release_date": "1993-01-06", "vote_average": 7.194, "vote_count": 611, "status": "Released", "tagline": "A rebellious young man.

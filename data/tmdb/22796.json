{"overview": "Simon Birch and Joe Wenteworth are boys who have a reputation for being oddballs. Joe never knew his father, and his mother, Rebecca, is keeping her lips sealed no matter how much he protests. Simon, meanwhile, is an 11-year-old dwarf whose outsize personality belies his small stature. Indeed, he often assails the local reverend with thorny theological questions and joins Joe on his quest to find his biological father.", "popularity": 11.634, "original_title": "Simon Birch", "runtime": 114, "release_date": "1998-09-11", "vote_average": 6.727, "vote_count": 216, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Destiny has big plans for little Simon Birch.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Ashley Judd|Ian Michael Smith|Joseph Mazzello|Oliver Platt|David Strathairn", "id": 22796}

{"overview": "The story of a gentle-hearted beast in love with a simple and beautiful girl. She is drawn to the repellent but strangely fascinating Beast, who tests her fidelity by giving her a key, telling her that if she doesn't return it to him by a specific time, he will die of grief. She is unable to return the key on time, but it is revealed that the Beast is the genuinely handsome one. A simple tale of tragic love that turns into a surreal vision of death, desire, and beauty.", "popularity": 17.918, "original_title": "La Belle et la B\u00eate", "runtime": 96, "release_date": "1946-10-29", "vote_average": 7.459, "vote_count": 538, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Once upon a time\u2026", "spoken_languages": "fr", "cast": "Jean Marais|Josette Day|Marcel Andr\u00e9|Mila Par\u00e9ly|Nane Germon", "id": 648}

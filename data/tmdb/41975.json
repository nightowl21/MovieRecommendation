{"overview": "France, World War II. In order to somehow make ends meet, the mother of two children, Marie Latour, does underground abortions and rents a room to a familiar prostitute. She doesn't pay any attention to her husband, who returned from the war because of his injury and lives her own life. Abortions gradually begin to bring a good income, and boredom can be easily dispelled by starting a young lover.", "popularity": 7.898, "original_title": "Une affaire de femmes", "runtime": 108, "release_date": "1988-09-14", "vote_average": 7.328, "vote_count": 137, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "fr|de", "cast": "Isabelle Huppert|Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet|Nils Tavernier|Marie Trintignant|Guillaume Foutrier", "id": 41975}

{"overview": "Josh's life is pretty much in the toilet. He's a failed NYC indie rocker, and a failing booking agent. But he finds the potential of a small victory in a really bad idea. He decides to purchase a 1985 Lazy Boy on eBay, just like the one his dad had when Josh was a kid. He'll drive cross-country for the chair, staying with Emily at his brother's house on the way, and deliver it to his father as a surprise birthday gift. But when Rhett ends up coming along for the ride, it's three people and a giant purple puffy chair in a too-small van... and one of them has to go before the trip's end.", "popularity": 2.702, "original_title": "The Puffy Chair", "runtime": 85, "release_date": "2006-06-02", "vote_average": 5.942, "vote_count": 43, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Mark Duplass|Katie Aselton|Rhett Wilkins|Julie Fischer|Larry Duplass", "id": 24055}

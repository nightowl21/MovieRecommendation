{"overview": "In 1966, Dieter Dengler was shot down over Laos, captured, and, down to 85 pounds, escaped. Barefoot, surviving monsoons, leeches, and machete-wielding villagers, he was rescued. Now, near 60, living on Mt. Tamalpais, Dengler tells his story: a German lad surviving Allied bombings in World War II, postwar poverty, apprenticed to a smith, beaten regularly. At 18, he emigrates and peels potatoes in the U.S. Air Force. He leaves for California and college, then enlistment in the Navy to learn to fly. A quiet man of sorrows tells his story: war, capture, harrowing conditions, escape, and miraculous rescue. Where did he find the strength; how does he now live with his memories?", "popularity": 4.474, "original_title": "Little Dieter Needs to Fly", "runtime": 80, "release_date": "1997-12-01", "vote_average": 7.461, "vote_count": 76, "status": "Released", "tagline": "In 1966, Dieter Dengler was shot down over Laos, captured, and, down to 85 pounds, escaped.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Dieter Dengler|Werner Herzog|Eugene Deatrick", "id": 57976}

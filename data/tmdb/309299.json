{"overview": "Yale University, 1961. Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think they\u2019re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects don\u2019t stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because they\u2019ve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmann\u2019s trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into people\u2019s tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha stands by him through it all.", "popularity": 12.261, "original_title": "Experimenter", "runtime": 97, "release_date": "2015-10-16", "vote_average": 6.543, "vote_count": 432, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The Stanley Milgram Story", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Peter Sarsgaard|Winona Ryder|Jim Gaffigan|Edoardo Ballerini|John Palladino", "id": 309299}

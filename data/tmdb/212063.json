{"overview": "Tim Jenison, a Texas based inventor, attempts to solve one of the greatest mysteries in all art: How did Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer manage to paint so photo-realistically 150 years before the invention of photography? Spanning a decade, Jenison's adventure takes him to Holland, on a pilgrimage to the North coast of Yorkshire to meet artista David Hockney, and eventually even to Buckingham Palace. The epic research project Jenison embarques on is as extraordinary as what he discovers.", "popularity": 7.055, "original_title": "Tim's Vermeer", "runtime": 80, "release_date": "2013-12-06", "vote_average": 7.229, "vote_count": 143, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Tim Jenison|Penn Jillette|Martin Mull|Teller|Philip Steadman", "id": 212063}

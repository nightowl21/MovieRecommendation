{"overview": "B.G. Bruno, a rich bachelor, the head of a successful greeting-card company in Scotland, is essentially a kind man but respectable to the point of stodginess and extreme stuffiness. An American troupe visiting Edinburgh wants to produce a musical in town but has trouble getting backers. Bruno meets several of the leading ladies of the show; through a misunderstanding he doesn't correct they think that he's a newspaper reporter. He falls in love with one of the women, who reciprocates; he grows more lively and friendly, to the surprise of his employees. After a series of mishaps and comic incidents comes a happy ending: a successful show and true love.", "popularity": 2.074, "original_title": "Happy Go Lovely", "runtime": 97, "release_date": "1951-03-06", "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 9, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Love...Fun...Youth...Set to Music!", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "David Niven|Vera-Ellen|Cesar Romero|Gordon Jackson|Bobby Howes", "id": 127602}

{"overview": "The actual experiences of New York City subway riders are dramatized in a collection of 10 intriguing and very different vignettes.

Among them: a disabled beggar quarrels with a woman and ruins her shoes with his wheelchair, provoking onlookers to wrath and pity; a skittish tourist proves to be her own worst enemy; a newlywed trysts with a mysterious sexpot; a commuter helplessly witnesses a suicide attempt; and, in the most affecting segment, a young woman grieves over her mother's imminent death.", "popularity": 1.593, "original_title": "Subway Stories: Tales from the Underground", "runtime": 81, "release_date": "1997-07-24", "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 8, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Every ride is as unpredictable as the city itself.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Jerry Stiller|Steve Zahn|Bill Irwin|KRS-One|Andre B.

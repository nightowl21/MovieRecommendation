{"overview": "Torn straight from the headlines, Michael Winterbottom's compelling and prescient 'In This World' follows young Afghan Jamal and his older cousin Enayat as they embark on a hazardous overland trip from their refugee camp at Peshawar, north-west Pakistan. Entering Turkey on foot through a snowy, Kurdish-controlled pass, the pair again take their lives into their hands and face suffocation when they are locked in a freight container on a ship bound for Italy. From there they plan to travel on to Paris, the Sangatte refuge centre and ultimately asylum in London.", "popularity": 3.865, "original_title": "In This World", "runtime": 88, "release_date": "2002-11-17", "vote_average": 6.348, "vote_count": 46, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The journey to freedom has no borders.", "spoken_languages": "de|en|tr|fa", "cast": "Jamal Udin Torabi|Enayatullah|Imran Paracha|Nabil Elouahabi", "id": 36791}

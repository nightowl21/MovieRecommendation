{"overview": "It\u2019s always been a dream of mine to do a show at the Fillmore. The name itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that history was something I\u2019ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep my head together before the show, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. \u2013 Bill Burr", "popularity": 5.068, "original_title": "Bill Burr: Let It Go", "runtime": 65, "release_date": "2010-09-18", "vote_average": 7.652, "vote_count": 92, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Bill Burr", "id": 46967}

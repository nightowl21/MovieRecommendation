{"overview": "It's San Francisco in 1957, and an American masterpiece is put on trial. Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and mind-expanding animation that echoes the startling originality of the poem itself. All three coalesce in a genre-bending hybrid that brilliantly captures a pivotal moment-the birth of a counterculture.", "popularity": 7.864, "original_title": "Howl", "runtime": 84, "release_date": "2010-08-26", "vote_average": 6.485, "vote_count": 166, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The Obscenity Trial That Started a Revolution.

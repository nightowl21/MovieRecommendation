As these emotions swirl, Tony meets his US Postal Service letter carrier, a single mom named Kathy who's come to LA from Wyoming with her daughter, a budding actress. Chris meets Anna, an Italian beauty working in the States for a few months wrangling animals on movie sets. Chris also befriends Clive, an aging and crusty man whose longing for his recently-deceased wife is a portrait of true love. Can Clive's example help Chris sort out his love life, and can Tony grow up enough to see the possibilities with Kathy and her daughter?", "popularity": 0.997, "original_title": "Smiling Fish & Goat On Fire", "runtime": 90, "release_date": "1999-09-16", "vote_average": 5.571, "vote_count": 7, "status": "Released", "tagline": "two brothers, four women and the search for Magnetic Perfection", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Derick Martini|Amy Hathaway|Steven Martini|Wilda Taylor|Rena Riffel", "id": 125537}

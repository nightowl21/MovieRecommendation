{"overview": "A highly-evolved planet, whose denizens feel no emotion and reproduce by cloning, plans to take over Earth from the inside by sending an operative, fashioned with a humming, mechanical penis, to impregnate an earthling and stay until the birth. The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?", "popularity": 9.591, "original_title": "What Planet Are You From?", "runtime": 105, "release_date": "2000-03-03", "vote_average": 5.454, "vote_count": 141, "status": "Released", "tagline": "To save his planet, an alien must find a woman on Earth to have his baby.

{"overview": "Snowflake is special, he's the only white gorilla in the world. He is the zoo's main attraction, children love him, but the other gorillas don't see what's so charming about this weirdo being the center of attention. With the help of Ailur, a Buddhist black panther reincarnated into the body of a red panda, and Paula, a smart little girl, Snowflake plans a sneak visit to the witch at the circus. She can help him be a normal gorilla. But outside the safety of the zoo's walls, the three friends are in danger. Thomas, a total jinx, is convinced that the white gorilla is the amulet he needs to counter his bad luck. This cruel and superstitious man is prepared to do whatever it takes to capture Snowflake.", "popularity": 7.634, "original_title": "Floquet de Neu", "runtime": 86, "release_date": "2011-12-23", "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 43, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Being Different Is A Real Adventure", "spoken_languages": "en|ca", "cast": "Claudia Abate|Pere Ponce|Joan Sull\u00e0|Elsa Pataky|Rosa Boladeras", "id": 85439}

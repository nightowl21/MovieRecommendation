{"overview": "Helvetica is a feature-length independent film about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. The film is an exploration of urban spaces in major cities and the type that inhabits them, and a fluid discussion with renowned designers about their work, the creative process, and the choices and aesthetics behind their use of type.", "popularity": 7.651, "original_title": "Helvetica", "runtime": 80, "release_date": "2007-09-12", "vote_average": 7.204, "vote_count": 157, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "de|en", "cast": "Michael Bierut|Neville Brody|David Carson|Manfred Schulz|Massimo Vignelli", "id": 13348}

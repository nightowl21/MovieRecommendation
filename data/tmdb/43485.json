{"overview": "Swellegant and elegant. Delux and delovely. Cole Porter was the most sophisticated name in 20th-century songwriting. And to play him on screen, Hollywood chose debonair icon Cary Grant. Grant stars for the first time in color in this fanciful biopic. Alexis Smith plays Linda, whose serendipitous meetings with Porter lead to a meeting at the alter. More than 20 of his songs grace this tail of triumph and tragedy, with Grant lending is amiable voice to \"You're the Top\", \"Night and Day\" and more. Monty Woolley, a Yale contemporary of Porter, portrays himself. And Jane Wyman, Mary Martin, Eve Arden and others provide vocals and verve. Lights down. Curtain up. Showtune standards embraced by generations are yours to enjoy in \"Night and Day.\"", "popularity": 5.921, "original_title": "Night and Day", "runtime": 128, "release_date": "1946-07-02", "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 26, "status": "Released", "tagline": "The story of Cole Porter with those Cole Porter song sensations !!!", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Cary Grant|Alexis Smith|Monty Woolley|Ginny Simms|Jane Wyman", "id": 43485}

{"overview": "Freddie is an inept bank clerk with no future. His only hobby is collecting butterflies, which gives him a feeling of power and control that is otherwise totally missing from his life. He comes into a large sum of money and buys himself a country house. Still unable to make himself at ease socially, he starts to plan on acquiring a girlfriend - in the same manner as he collects butterflies. He prepares the cellar of the house to be a collecting jar and stalks his victim over several days.", "popularity": 10.858, "original_title": "The Collector", "runtime": 119, "release_date": "1965-06-17", "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 172, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Almost a love story.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Terence Stamp|Samantha Eggar|Mona Washbourne|Maurice Dallimore|Edina Ronay", "id": 42740}

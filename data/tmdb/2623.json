{"overview": "Zack Mayo is an aloof, taciturn man who aspires to be a navy pilot. Once he arrives at training camp for his 13-week officer's course, Mayo runs afoul of abrasive, no-nonsense drill Sergeant Emil Foley. Mayo is an excellent cadet, but a little cold around the heart, so Foley rides him mercilessly, sensing that the young man would be prime officer material if he weren't so self-involved. Zack's affair with a working girl is likewise compromised by his unwillingness to give of himself.", "popularity": 27.295, "original_title": "An Officer and a Gentleman", "runtime": 124, "release_date": "1982-07-28", "vote_average": 7.012, "vote_count": 1002, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Life gave him nothing, except the courage to win...and a woman to love.", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Richard Gere|Debra Winger|Louis Gossett Jr.|David Keith|Robert Loggia", "id": 2623}

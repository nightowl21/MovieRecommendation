{"overview": "Posing for a portrait, Dorian Gray talks with Lord Henry Wotton, who says that men should pursue their sensual longings, but laments that only the young get to do so. Taken with the idea, Dorian imagines a scenario in which the painting will age as he stays youthful. His wish comes true, and his boyish looks aid him as he indulges his every whim. But when a stunning revelation forces him to see what he's become, Dorian faces some very dangerous questions.", "popularity": 15.93, "original_title": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "runtime": 111, "release_date": "1945-03-03", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 232, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Why did women talk about Dorian Gray in whispers?", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Hurd Hatfield|George Sanders|Donna Reed|Angela Lansbury|Peter Lawford", "id": 16559}

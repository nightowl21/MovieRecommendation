When Oscar is killed by police during a bust gone bad, his spirit journeys from the past -- where he sees his parents before their deaths -- to the present -- where he witnesses his own autopsy -- and then to the future, where he looks out for his sister from beyond the grave.", "popularity": 17.549, "original_title": "Enter the Void", "runtime": 161, "release_date": "2009-06-17", "vote_average": 7.348, "vote_count": 1627, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en|ja", "cast": "Paz de la Huerta|Nathaniel Brown|Cyril Roy|Olly Alexander|Masato Tanno", "id": 34647}

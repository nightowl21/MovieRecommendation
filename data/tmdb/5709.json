{"overview": "Acclaimed director John Landis (Animal House, The Blues Brothers) presents this madcap send-up of late night TV, low-budget sci-fi films and canned-laughter-filled sitcoms packed with off-the-wall sketches that will have you in stitches. Centered around a television station which features a 1950s-style sci-fi movie interspersed with a series of wild commercials, wacky shorts and weird specials, this lampoon of contemporary life and pop culture skewers some of the silliest spectacles ever created in the name of entertainment. A truly outrageous look at the best of the worst that television has to offer.", "popularity": 8.466, "original_title": "Amazon Women on the Moon", "runtime": 85, "release_date": "1987-09-18", "vote_average": 6.024, "vote_count": 143, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Michelle Pfeiffer|Peter Horton|Monique Gabrielle|Steve Forrest|Griffin Dunne", "id": 5709}

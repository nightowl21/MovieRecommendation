In the same morning he learns that his daughter is pregnant, an employee stole a large amount of money from his company, his maid is about to resign in order to marry a wealthy neighbor and his body builder is interested in marrying his daughter. The seemingly complicated story-line is full of comedy or errors and some of the most hilarious mime scenes of the French cinema.", "popularity": 10.782, "original_title": "Oscar", "runtime": 85, "release_date": "1967-10-11", "vote_average": 7.367, "vote_count": 444, "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "spoken_languages": "fr", "cast": "Louis de Fun\u00e8s|Claude Rich|Agathe Natanson|Claude Gensac|Sylvia Saurel", "id": 2798}

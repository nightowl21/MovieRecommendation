{"overview": "The \"bad boys of magic\" go over the edge in this mind-blowing, role-switching comedy murder mystery set in the dizzying world of Atlantic City casinos. In a TV interview, Penn mentions his idea of a fun practical joke: \"I wish someone were trying to kill me. It would give focus to my life, excitement. I'd be like James Bond.\" Twenty million people hear him. One decides to deliver a punchline he'll never forget. Made by people who thought Psycho was a comedy, Penn & Teller Get Killed (they also wrote the piece) features Caitlin Clarke as the femme fatale and David Patrick Kelly as the Edgar Allan Poe-esque nutcase with a new mission. Arthur Penn, known for hip masterpieces like Bonnie and Clyde, Alice's Restaurant and Little Big Man, directs with roller-coaster pacing and subversive intelligence.", "popularity": 3.511, "original_title": "Penn & Teller Get Killed", "runtime": 89, "release_date": "1989-09-22", "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 28, "status": "Released", "tagline": "What more do you want?", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Penn Jillette|Teller|Caitlin Clarke|David Patrick Kelly|Leonardo Cimino", "id": 37146}

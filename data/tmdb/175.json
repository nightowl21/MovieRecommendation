{"overview": "Two men answer the call of the ocean in this romantic fantasy-adventure.  Jacques and Enzo are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men.  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana, a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.", "popularity": 25.985, "original_title": "Le Grand Bleu", "runtime": 168, "release_date": "1988-05-10", "vote_average": 7.458, "vote_count": 1331, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Danger...Like Passion...Runs Deep", "spoken_languages": "en|fr|it", "cast": "Jean-Marc Barr|Jean Reno|Rosanna Arquette|Paul Shenar|Sergio Castellitto", "id": 175}

{"overview": "Recorded November 10th, 2011 as part of the New York Comedy Festival, and only available for purchase online, Louis C.K. follows up his 2010 concert film Hilarious with a new hour\u2019s worth of shrewdly observed and periodically profane material. He starts with making his own kind of please-turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement, as well as a warning not to text or tweet during the show: \u201cJust live your life,\u201d he asks. Whether he\u2019s talking about a unique way to drop a rental car off at an airport or describing why a man in his 40s should not smoke dope, it\u2019s terrific, humane, carried-to-crazed-extremes stuff.", "popularity": 4.486, "original_title": "Louis C.K.: Live at the Beacon Theater", "runtime": 62, "release_date": "2011-12-10", "vote_average": 7.811, "vote_count": 209, "status": "Released", "tagline": "Buy The Thing", "spoken_languages": "en", "cast": "Louis C.K.", "id": 80379}
